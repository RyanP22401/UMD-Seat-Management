# UMD-Seat-Management
Unable to get a seat in a class because of UMD's Seat Management Plan? This allows you to automatically check for seats every so often to see if they've opened any more up
The code itself has the provided variables that should be changed, but they are as follows
url -> url of the schedule of classes page, after searching for the desired class
pos -> position of the desired section, 0 indexed
timeBetweenChecks -> seconds between checks
